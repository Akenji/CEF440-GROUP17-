## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **mobile-based attendance management system** designed to automate and secure student attendance in academic institutions using a combination of **facial recognition** and **geofencing** technologies.

Traditional attendance methods are often inefficient, error-prone, and susceptible to manipulation (e.g., proxy attendance). This system addresses those limitations by verifying both **identity (via face recognition)** and **physical presence (via GPS coordinates)**, ensuring accurate and real-time attendance monitoring.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Manual and semi-digital attendance systems in universities have several issues:
- Time-consuming processes
- High susceptibility to human error and impersonation
- Delayed or inaccessible attendance records

### ✅ This project addresses the above issues by:
- Automating attendance using biometrics and location data
- Supporting real-time check-in and reporting
- Enhancing data integrity and monitoring efficiency

---

## 🎯 Aim

To **design and implement a secure, real-time mobile attendance system** that:
- Uses **facial recognition** for identity verification
- Applies **geofencing** to validate location
- Enables both students and instructors to manage and monitor attendance effortlessly

---

## ✅ Expected Outcomes

A fully functional mobile application that:
- Supports **real-time facial recognition-based check-in**
- Verifies physical presence using **GPS geofencing**
- Processes attendance in **under 5 seconds per student**
- Secures biometric data using encrypted storage
- Defines and enforces **virtual classroom boundaries**
- Allows instructors to view and manage real-time attendance logs
- Offers filters by **course**, **date**, or **student**
- Allows students to track their attendance history and participation records
